## Goal

*Build an Employee Management System (EMS) that helps companies manage employees, tasks, and roles using a clean React UI with LocalStorage-based data persistence, so they can organize workflow efficiently without needing a backend or database.*

## Who Is This For

*For small teams, startups, and learners who currently manage employee tasks manually or through spreadsheets, and want a simple, fast, UI-based system to handle employees, admins, login states, and task assignments without backend complexity.*

## MVP Features

- 🔐 **Authentication System** (Login/Logout using Context API + LocalStorage)
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Dashboard** (Manage employees + tasks)
- 👨‍💻 **Employee Dashboard** (View assigned tasks)
- 📦 **LocalStorage Data Persistence** (users, roles, tasks)
- 📁 **Role-Based Routing & Access Control**
- 📝 **Task Creation & Assignment**
